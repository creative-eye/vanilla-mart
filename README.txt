This is a vanilla js only project I wrote as part as a hiring process that I am really proud of. I have published it to github to highlight my vanilla js skills.

In order to run the app please do the following steps:

1. Install node.js using nvm on linux
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-with-nvm-node-version-manager-on-a-vps
 
or executables on win/mac.

2. cd to project root and run:
```
npm i -g webpack
npm i
```

After that to run the dev server run:
```
npm run dev
```
Open localhost:3000 and happy coding.

Or for production server:
```
npm run prod
```

The result can also be seen by opening the backup folder and clicking index.html

Know issues:

- no linter added;
- no unit tests;
